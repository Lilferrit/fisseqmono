"""CORRELATE_FEATURES -- per-dimension agreement between two split halves.

Stage 2c of the reproducibility-filtering chain, adapted from
fisseq-data-pipeline's ``correlatefeatures.py``.

For one bootstrap replicate and one aggregation method, joins the two
AGGREGATE_HALF outputs on the variant label -- so each row of the join
pairs a variant's half-1 aggregate with its half-2 aggregate -- and takes
the Pearson correlation of those two columns **across variants**, one
correlation per embedding dimension.

That is what "reproducible" means here: a dimension is reproducible if
the variant-to-variant pattern it reports from one random half of the
cells is the pattern it reports from the other half. A dimension that
mostly measures noise correlates near zero however large its values are.

    """
    Per-dimension Pearson correlation between two half-aggregates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df1, df2 : pl.DataFrame
        The two halves' aggregates for one method: ``label_col`` plus one
        column per embedding dimension. Same schema.
    label_col : str
        Column the two frames are aligned on (one row per variant).

    Returns
    -------
    pl.DataFrame
        One row per dimension: ``feature``, ``r``, ``r_squared``. ``r`` is
        **null** for a dimension that is constant in either half -- Polars'
        ``corr`` of a zero-variance column is NaN, which is normalized to
        null here on purpose. NaN would propagate through BLOCKLIST's
        median and condemn a dimension outright on the strength of one
        degenerate replicate; null is skipped by ``median``, so the
        dimension is judged on the replicates that actually produced a
        number. A dimension that was degenerate in *every* replicate gets a
        null median, which fails the threshold comparison and is blocked --
        the right verdict, since it carried no variant-to-variant signal at
        all.

    Notes
    -----
    Uses ``FEATURE_SELECTOR`` (exclude ``meta_*``), not
    ``EMBEDDING_SELECTOR``: AGGREGATE_HALF's columns are stat-suffixed
    (``emb_0000_KS``), which ``EMBEDDING_SELECTOR``'s ``^emb_\\d+$`` does
    not match.
