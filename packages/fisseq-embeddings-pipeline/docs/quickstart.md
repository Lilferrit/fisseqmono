# Quickstart

## 1. Lay out one experiment's inputs

Each experiment needs an entry in `params.yaml`'s `experiments:` list, plus
a `--pipeline_dir` directory holding that experiment's raw data:

```yaml
# params.yaml
window: 224   # must match your Cell-DINO checkpoint's crop size -- global
              # default, used by every experiment below that doesn't set
              # its own `window`

experiments:
  - batch_stem: experiment1
    starcall_workflow_dir: /data/experiment1   # starcall's working directory for this
                                                # experiment: its config.yaml and data
                                                # trees (starcall's code comes from the
                                                # image's pinned commit, not from here).
                                                # IS this experiment's root, no separate
                                                # folder needed
    # phenotyping_dir/segmentation_dir/sequencing_dir omitted -- each is
    # auto-resolved: starcall_workflow_dir's own config.yaml (or
    # default-config.yaml) is consulted first if present, else it falls
    # back to a subdirectory of starcall_workflow_dir
    # (phenotyping/segmentation/sequencing); set one explicitly only if
    # your lab's data for that tree isn't colocated under
    # starcall_workflow_dir at all.
    wells: [well1, well2]
    # grid_size omitted -- auto-detected per well from phenotyping_dir's
    # own {well}_grid<N> directory naming. Set it explicitly (e.g.
    # grid_size: 12) when starting from raw input, with nothing under
    # phenotyping_dir yet: every tile of the grid is then requested.
    # window omitted -- falls back to the global `window` default above.
```

These starcall-workflow-facing fields all belong to `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`,
the one stage that touches `starcall-workflow`'s tree -- see
[`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' section of the Architecture doc](architecture.md#cell-images-build_cell_images-output-from-starcall-workflow)
for every field it accepts, including `window` (the crop size each tile's
shard is cut at -- see [Cell Shards](cli/tile_shard.md)). The remaining
`*_col_name` fields go to `BUILD_CELL_METADATA` and `BUILD_CP_FEATURES`.

## 2. Get a Cell-DINO checkpoint

`--cell_dino_checkpoint` is required, with no default (a checkpoint path is
inherently deployment-specific). Point it at a real `.pth` file; see
[Architecture](architecture.md#embed_cells-cell-dino-inference-internals)
for what checkpoint shapes are supported.

## 3. Run the pipeline

```bash
nextflow run . -params-file params.yaml \
    --pipeline_dir /path/to/experiment1 \
    --cell_dino_checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint.pth
```

`-params-file params.yaml` is mandatory -- there is no embedded fallback
for pipeline defaults (see [Configuration](configuration.md)). Any field in
`params.yaml` can be overridden on the command line as `--key value`, e.g.
`--ovwt_min_cells 500`.

That runs every task inside the image named by `container_image`, under
Docker. Add `-profile apptainer` to use Apptainer instead (the usual choice
on a cluster), and `-c site.config` for your cluster's executor settings --
see [Nextflow Workflow](nextflow.md#running-on-a-cluster-bring-your-own-profiles).
On a GPU-less Docker host, also pass `--starcall_gpu false --cell_dino_device cpu`
(Docker's `--gpus` fails outright without a GPU).

Add `-resume` to a rerun to reuse every task whose inputs haven't changed.
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' own nested starcall run is mtime-based on its own, so
already-computed starcall outputs are reused either way.

## 4. Read the outputs

Every stage's output lands under `<pipeline_dir>/`, one subdirectory per
stage (`cell_images/`, `dataset/`, `qc_filter/`, `embeddings/`,
`filter_embeddings/`, `feature_select_batchwise/`, `ovwt_batchwise/`). See
[Nextflow Workflow](nextflow.md#output-directory-layout) for the full tree
and [Architecture](architecture.md#data-contracts) for what each Parquet
file's columns mean.

## Running multiple experiments together

Add another map to `params.yaml`'s `experiments:` list (with its own
unique `batch_stem`) -- every stage runs once per entry. To pool the
experiments, run `fisseqborn-global <pipeline_dir> --out <dir>` (the
fisseqborn package) on the finished run: it votes the blocklists across
experiments, takes each variant's median and runs the PCA, for both tracks,
and pools the OvWT scores.
