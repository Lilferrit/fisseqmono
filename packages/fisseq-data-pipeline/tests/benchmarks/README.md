# Aggregation benchmarks

Not collected by `pytest` — `pyproject.toml` sets
`testpaths = ["tests/unit", "tests/integration"]`, so this directory is
excluded from the default run. Run the scripts directly.

These exist because the aggregation stage's cost is a *memory* problem, not a
throughput one, and peak RSS is invisible to the unit tests. Before this
harness, `aggregate.py`'s docstrings cited benchmark numbers from a file
(`benchmark_pvalue_aggregators.py`) that was never committed.

## Why

On the 111925 cluster run, every `KS`, `AUROC`, `KSnegLogP` and
`AUROCnegLogP` task was OOM-killed (exit 137) inside `sink_parquet` — 714 of
947 aggregation tasks produced no output, silently, because every process
carries `errorStrategy 'ignore'`. `BaseAggregator.aggregate` now evaluates
`feature_chunk_size` features per query instead of all ~1731 at once.

## Usage

```bash
# 1. Generate a synthetic cell-level parquet at production shape.
#    (500k cells x 1731 features is ~8.5 GB on disk; start smaller.)
uv run python tests/benchmarks/generate_benchmark_data.py \
    /tmp/bench.parquet --n-cells 150000 --n-features 2048 --n-variants 1000

# 2. Sweep chunk sizes, one subprocess per case, with an RSS watchdog that
#    emulates the cluster's OOM kill instead of waiting for the real one.
uv run python tests/benchmarks/benchmark_aggregate_chunking.py \
    /tmp/bench.parquet --aggregators median AUROC KS QQ \
    --chunk-sizes 8 16 32 64 128 --budget-mb 5000
```

`--budget-mb` should be set to whatever memory the cluster actually grants
these tasks (they declare `label 'process_medium'`, which `nextflow.config`
deliberately leaves unsized).

## Reference numbers

150k cells x 2048 features x 1000 variants, 7500 control cells, 5 GB budget.
`chunk = 2048` is a single query, i.e. the pre-chunking behaviour — it OOMs
for every aggregator, which is the production failure reproduced.

Seconds / peak RSS in MB. Two things this table is meant to settle:

1. **Runtime is flat in chunk size for the expensive aggregators** (AUROC
   moved 160 s -> 167 s across a 16x range). Chunk size is a memory dial, not
   a speed/memory trade-off — halving it when a task is killed costs
   essentially nothing.
2. **`KS` pins the default.** It OOMs at 128 where `AUROC` still has headroom.
   `params.aggregate_feature_chunk_size` defaults to 32, sized to the
   cluster's per-task memory rather than to this table -- see below.

Peak memory scales with `chunk_size x n_variant_labels` (times the control
pool, for the reference-based aggregators), so these numbers do **not** transfer
to a differently-shaped batch -- see below.

## At production shape

500k cells x 1731 features x 1900 variants, ~25k control cells. The table above
was measured on a batch a third that size, and the difference matters:

| aggregator | chunk 32/16/4 | chunk 1 |
|---|---|---|
| mean / median / std / MAD | 5-7 s / ~1500 MB (at chunk 64) | - |
| AUROC | OOM above 5.6 GB at chunk 4 | 999 s / 3273 MB |
| KS | OOM above 5.7 GB at chunk 4 | >50 min, not completed |
| QQ | OOM above 5.7 GB at chunk 4 | not measured |

(Measured on a 7 GB box, so "OOM" here means "needs more than ~5.6 GB", not
"cannot work" -- these were re-measured against a larger budget on the
cluster.)

Two things follow, and they are the reason `aggregate_feature_chunk_size`
exists as a parameter rather than a constant:

1. **The plain stats are no longer a problem at any chunk size.** ~1.5 GB and a
   few seconds at production shape, where the pre-chunking code OOM-killed.
2. **The reference-based aggregators cost roughly 3 GB (AUROC) to 4.5 GB (KS)
   *per feature in the chunk* at this shape.** So the usable chunk size is set
   by the memory one task is granted:
   `chunk_size ~= (memory_per_task_GB - 1) / 4.5`. The shipped default of 32
   assumes >=128 GB per task.

Chunking bounds the `n_features` factor but not the `n_variant_labels x
control_pool` one, which is what the cross-joined reference pool carries. If
that per-feature cost is the binding problem rather than the OOM, the fix is
to replace the Polars list-expression kernels with numpy/`searchsorted`
kernels that sort the control pool once per feature -- prototyped and verified
bit-comparable during planning at **KS 132 s, AUROC 157 s, QQ 50 s, flat
~900 MB** on exactly the shape above.
