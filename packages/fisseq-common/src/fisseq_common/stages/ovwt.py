"""One-vs-wildtype (OvWT) distinguishability scoring: the OVWT_BATCHWISE stage.

For every variant in an experiment, XGBoost classifiers separate its cells from wildtype cells
under k-fold cross-validation stratified jointly on ``(meta_barcode, is_wt)``, giving an
out-of-fold score for every cell and several distinguishability numbers per variant:

- ``auroc_pooled`` -- over all of the variant's cells at once.
- ``auroc_median_barcode`` -- each of the variant's barcodes scored separately against the full
  wildtype set, then medianed; surfaces whether the signal is broad-based across barcodes or
  driven by one or two outliers.
- ``auroc_folds`` / ``auroc_median_fold`` -- each fold's test slice scored by that fold's own
  model (one entry per fold, ``null`` for a single-class slice), and the median of the defined
  entries. The pooled and per-barcode numbers mix scores from different fold models, which do
  not share a scale, into one ROC curve; a per-fold AUROC only ever ranks one model's scores.

**Two cross-validation schemes**, selected by ``cv_mode``:

- ``"kfold"`` (the default) -- ``n_folds`` folds, stratified jointly on
  ``(meta_barcode, is_wt)``. Every fold's model has seen every barcode, so the AUROCs measure
  separability *within* the barcodes trained on.
- ``"barcode_holdout"`` -- each fold holds a whole barcode (or, when ``n_folds`` groups them, a
  whole set of barcodes) out of training, so no model is ever trained on a barcode it later
  scores. ``n_folds = None`` gives one fold per barcode; an integer packs the barcodes into that
  many cell-count-balanced groups; a value above the barcode count degrades back to one fold per
  barcode. Wildtype cells are still split across the folds, so every cell still gets exactly one
  out-of-fold score and every output column keeps its meaning -- what changes is that they
  measure whether a variant's signal *generalizes to an unseen barcode*.

Which columns are features is the ``feature_selector`` field: the data pipeline and the
embeddings pipeline's CellProfiler track score CellProfiler features (``"features"``), the
embeddings track its embedding dimensions (``"embeddings"``). The cells come in normalized by the
filter stage, against the wildtype cells.

Entry point: ``python -m fisseq_common.stages.ovwt`` (:class:`OvwtConfig`): it rebuilds the
normalized cells (:func:`fisseq_common.stages.filter.load_cells`) and calls :func:`run_ovwt`.

    ----------
    label_column : str

    wt_label : str
        Label value identifying wildtype cells. Defaults to ``"WT"``.
    cv_mode : str
        Cross-validation scheme, one of :data:`CV_MODES`. Defaults to ``"kfold"``.
    n_folds : int or None
        Number of cross-validation folds per variant: fold count under ``"kfold"``, a cap on the
        barcode-group count under ``"barcode_holdout"``. ``None`` is valid only under
        ``"barcode_holdout"``, where it means one fold per barcode. Values below 2 are rejected.

    calibrate : bool
        If ``True``, fit a per-fold sigmoid (Platt) probability calibrator on a slice held out of
        that fold's training data before scoring its test slice. Defaults to ``True``.
    min_cells : Optional[int]
        Minimum number of cells a variant must have to be scored; variants below this are dropped
        before the per-variant loop (wildtype is always kept regardless of count). ``None``
        disables this filter. Defaults to ``250``.
    downsample_wt : bool
        If ``True``, downsample wildtype cells (barcode-proportionally) to the size of the
        largest remaining variant group before the per-variant loop. Defaults to ``True``.
    xgboost : XGBoostConfig
        XGBoost training-loop configuration (num_boost_round, early_stopping_rounds,

    Notes

    Pack the variant barcodes into one group per cross-validation fold.

    Each group is held out of training together by a single fold of

    ``n_folds`` is a cap, not a fixed size: ``None``, or any value at or above

    leave-one-barcode-out case.

    Grouping balances **cell** counts, not barcode counts. Barcodes are
    unevenly populated, and packing by barcode count alone can leave one fold
    holding out most of a variant's cells while another holds out a handful,
    which unbalances both the training sets and the per-fold AUROCs. The pack
    is the standard greedy longest-processing-time-first heuristic: barcodes
    sorted by cell count descending (ties broken by barcode string, for
    determinism), each assigned to the group with the smallest running cell

    Cross-validated one-vs-wildtype scoring per variant, on normalized cell features.

    ``cfg.cv_mode == "kfold"`` folds are stratified jointly on

    folds the variant's barcodes are packed into and ``None`` giving one fold

    A variant whose fold training/evaluation raises (e.g. too few cells for
