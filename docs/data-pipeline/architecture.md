# Architecture

The FISSEQ Data Pipeline is a Nextflow + Python workflow for processing
single-cell CellProfiler morphological profiling data from FISSEQ
(Fluorescence In-Situ Sequencing) experiments. Each cell carries a genetic
variant label; the pipeline measures how each variant's cell population differs
from wildtype (WT) controls using morphological features.

```

There is a single pipeline mode. `main.nf` includes one workflow,
`workflows/fisseq.nf`, and runs it. Every stage runs per experiment; nothing in
the pipeline combines experiments (see
[Cross-experiment aggregation](#cross-experiment-aggregation)).

## Experiments

Every experiment is declared as a map in the `experiments:` list in
`params.yaml`. There is no `<pipeline_dir>/configs/` directory, and no
per-experiment override of arbitrary pipeline parameters — an entry may set only
`batch_stem`, `input_paths`, and the three INPUT-stage fields.
Anything else is rejected with an error naming the key. See
[Configuration](configuration.md).

## Cross-experiment aggregation

The pipeline stops at per-experiment outputs. Combining experiments — merging
blocklists across experiments, z-scoring each experiment's per-variant profiles
and taking the per-variant median across experiments, and re-centering OvWT
AUROCs against synonymous variants before a cross-experiment median — is the job
of the downstream [fisseqborn](https://github.com/FowlerLab/fisseqborn) package.
It reads each experiment's published
`feature_select_batchwise/<batch_stem>/{aggregates,passthrough_aggregates,blocklists}/<feature_type>.parquet`
and `ovwt_batchwise/<batch_stem>/results.parquet`.

## Reproducibility

`params.random_seed` is the only seed in the pipeline. Every stochastic step
reads it: QC pseudo-variant downsampling, the feature-selection bootstrap splits
and their wildtype subsampling, OvWT's fold shuffle / inner calibration split /
XGBoost `seed`.

Stages that must differ from one another derive a fixed offset rather than
owning a seed — `GENERATE_SPLIT` uses `random_seed + bootstrap_idx`, and
`AGGREGATE_HALF` uses `random_seed + bootstrap_idx * 2 + half_num`, so bootstrap
replicates still draw independent subsamples. `tests/unit/test_config.py` sweeps
every config class to keep a second seed from reappearing.

Reproducibility also depends on **row order** being stable, which is easy to
lose: polars inner joins are not order-preserving under multithreaded execution.
`QC_FILTER` therefore assigns `meta_cell_index` over the raw input order and
sorts on it before publishing. Without that, the same input yields the same rows
in a different order on every run, and every seeded step downstream silently
diverges despite a fixed seed.

## Two different control baselines

These are easy to confuse:

| Stage | Control population |
| ----- | ------------------ |
| `NORMALIZE` (cell level) | **Wildtype** cells (`meta_aa_changes = 'WT'`) |
| `AGGREGATE_FEATURE_TYPE` (aggregate level, `normalize_to_synonymous`) | **Synonymous** variants |
| `FINALIZE_FEATURE_SELECT` (aggregate level) | **Synonymous** variants |

`aggregate.variant_classification` flags synonymous, untagged labels as
`meta_is_control = True`; `normalize.py` uses the WT SQL query instead. Both
synonymous-baseline normalizations fit a `ddof=1` std, so each experiment needs
at least two synonymous variants — with one, every feature comes out null.

Note that `OVWT_BATCHWISE` consumes `NORMALIZE`'s wildtype-normalized output.
The sibling `fisseq-embeddings-pipeline`, from which the OvWT implementation was
ported, z-scores its features against synonymous variants before training
instead. The difference is deliberate: the synonymous re-centering happens at
the score level, on the AUROCs, downstream in fisseqborn.

## Variant tags

`aaChanges` values may carry a `:<tag>` suffix (e.g. `V123A:downsampled-half`).
The tag is stripped exactly once, in `qcfilter.py:filter_columns`:
`meta_aa_changes` is always the tag-stripped base label and `meta_variant_tag`
holds the tag (`null` when absent). Every stage after `QC_FILTER` therefore sees
clean, pooled variant labels. Do not re-strip or re-parse tags downstream — use
`meta_variant_tag` directly.

Two independent things can put a tag there: upstream raw data may arrive
pre-tagged, or `qcfilter.py`'s optional pseudo-variant downsampling
(`qc_downsample_amounts`) may generate one (`downsample-{amount}`) for the rows
it creates.

## Column naming

| Pattern | Meaning |
| ------- | ------- |
| `meta_*` | Metadata (barcode, batch, labels, QC flags, scores, cell index) |
| `UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORE` | CellProfiler morphological feature columns |
| `tmp_*` | Ephemeral intermediates, dropped before output |

The `meta_` prefix is load-bearing: `FEATURE_SELECTOR` is defined as
`exclude("^meta_.*$")`, so any new non-`meta_` column is treated as a feature.

## Components

- `src/fisseq_data_pipeline/` — Python package, one module per pipeline step,
  each a Hydra entry point run as `python -m fisseq_data_pipeline.<module>`
- `modules/local/*.nf` and the repository root's `nextflow/modules/local/` (shared with the
  embeddings pipeline, configured by `conf/modules.config`) — Nextflow process wrappers
  around those CLIs
- `workflows/fisseq.nf` — the DAG
- `main.nf` — entry point
- `params.yaml` — every parameter default
- `nextflow.config` — executor/profile/container settings only
- `Dockerfile` — the single image every process runs in
