# Nextflow workflow reference

## Entry point

`main.nf` runs the single `EmbeddingsPipeline` workflow
(`workflows/embeddings.nf`). The cellDINO-specific processes live in this package's
`modules/local/<name>/main.nf`; every process downstream of them is a shared module,
`packages/fisseq-common/nextflow/modules/local/<stage>/main.nf` (see
[Shared modules](#shared-modules)).

```bash
nextflow run . -params-file params.yaml \
    --pipeline_dir /path/to/run \
    --cell_dino_checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint.pth \
    [-profile apptainer|local] [-c site.config] [-resume] [--key value ...]
```

`--key value` on the command line wins over `-params-file`. Nextflow's own
`work/` directory and `.nextflow/` state land in the directory you launch
from, not in `pipeline_dir`; published results go to `pipeline_dir` (see the
[output tree](#output-directory-layout)).

### Validation: `PLAN_EXPERIMENTS`

The workflow's first task is `PLAN_EXPERIMENTS`. The workflow serializes the
run's `params` to JSON (`<workDir>/fisseq_params.json`) and the task runs
`python -m fisseq_embeddings_pipeline.config.experiments` over it, which
validates everything and writes back one plan per experiment: every stage's
Hydra override string, already rendered, plus the host paths
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` needs bound (see [Bind mounts](#bind-mounts)).

A missing `pipeline_dir` or `cell_dino_checkpoint`, an empty `experiments`
list, an unknown or overlapping aggregator name, fewer than two bootstrap
replicates, an `ovwt_cv_mode` outside `kfold`/`barcode_holdout` (or an
`ovwt_n_folds` below 2, or `null` outside `barcode_holdout`), or a
`starcall_profile` without a `starcall_job_image` all fail
there, with a specific `ERROR: ...` message in the task's error output,
before any other task is scheduled. `PLAN_EXPERIMENTS` is the one process
without `errorStrategy 'ignore'`: a bad params file stops the run.

Keeping validation and routing in `config/experiments.py` rather than in
`workflows/embeddings.nf`'s Groovy keeps it ordinary, unit-tested Python
(`tests/unit/test_experiments.py`), and running it as a task means it runs
in the pipeline image like everything else. The launching host needs
nothing but Nextflow.

## Per-experiment configs

Every entry in `params.yaml`'s `experiments:` list supplies fields for
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` (starcall-workflow-facing: `starcall_workflow_dir`,
`phenotyping_dir`, `segmentation_dir`, `sequencing_dir`, `wells`,
`grid_size`, `use_corrected`, `window`, ...) and for the two stages reading
its `cell_table.parquet`, `BUILD_CELL_METADATA` and `BUILD_CP_FEATURES` (the
`*_col_name` overrides; `BUILD_CP_FEATURES` runs only for `cp_features:
true` entries). `batch_stem` is a required key inside each entry and must
be unique across the list.

`config/experiments.py` routes each key to the stage(s) owning it and
renders the plan's `cell_images_args` and `cell_table_args` as Hydra CLI
overrides; `cell_table_args` goes to both cell-table readers, so the two
tracks read the table with the same column names. `window` has a
pipeline-wide default (`params.window`) filled into an entry's
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`-bound overrides when the entry doesn't set its own --
it's the crop size each tile's shard is cut at, and it names the shard
target. `cellprofiler_pipeline`/`cellprofiler_cycle` work the same way. An
entry's own value always wins.

```

Downstream of `EMBED_CELLS` this is fisseq-data-pipeline's graph: the same shared modules,
process names, parameters and publish layout. Only the cell table differs (embedding
dimensions instead of CellProfiler features), and with it the cell identity (`join_keys`) and
`feature_selector`, which `conf/modules.config` sets. See [Shared stages](../common/stages.md).

Every process runs per experiment. Pooling experiments is done afterwards by
`fisseqborn-global` (the fisseqborn package), from the published outputs.

`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` runs unconditionally for every experiment (not gated
on `cp_features`) -- both the cellDINO track above and the CellProfiler
track below depend on its output.

`QC_FILTER` runs off `BUILD_CELL_METADATA`, not the image-reading
cellDINO track.
`BUILD_CELL_METADATA` (`cell_metadata.py`) is a flat projection of
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' `cell_table.parquet` down to the seven `meta_*`
columns QC reads (`meta_batch`/`meta_well`/`meta_tile`/`meta_cell_index` --
the pipeline's `join_keys` -- plus `meta_barcode`/`meta_aa_changes`/
`meta_edit_distance`). That makes `QC_FILTER` the point where the two
tracks fan out: see
[Track independence](#track-independence) below. `QC_FILTER` is the data
pipeline's, including `qc_n_variants` and the pseudo-variant downsampling
(`qc_downsample_amounts`); both are off by default.

`EMBED_CELLS` streams every tile's WebDataset shard (cut inside
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' nested snakemake by `make_cell_shard` -- see
[Cell Shards](cli/tile_shard.md)) and has no dependency on `QC_FILTER` --
the whole point of building the shards up front is that this expensive
GPU pass runs once per experiment regardless of how many times QC
thresholds get retuned afterward. A shard's `meta.json` carries only the
cell's location; `EMBED_CELLS` joins every other `meta_*` column on from
`BUILD_CELL_METADATA`'s `metadata.parquet`.
`NORMALIZE` joins `EMBED_CELLS`' output against `QC_FILTER`'s
`filtered_cells.parquet` (only that one of `QC_FILTER`'s three outputs;
the other two are informational QC-report files) and fits the normalizer on the wildtype
cells. Every later stage takes the same three inputs (`embeddings.parquet`,
`filtered_keys.parquet`, `normalizer.parquet`) and rebuilds the QC-passed, normalized table
itself; none reads a pre-normalized file.

`params.embeddings_only: true` stops the cellDINO track after
`EMBED_CELLS` and skips everything downstream of it, the CellProfiler
track included -- for when all you want is the embeddings. The
containerized real-starcall integration tests use it.

### Feature selection

`AGGREGATE_FEATURE_TYPE_BATCHWISE` through `FINALIZE_FEATURE_SELECT_BATCHWISE` are the data
pipeline's bootstrap feature selection, on the cellDINO track only (see
[Shared stages](../common/stages.md#aggregate) for what each computes). About the wiring:

- **The fan-out is channel combinatorics.** `GENERATE_SPLIT_BATCHWISE` gets one task per
  `channel.of(1..feature_select_bootstrap_reps)`; each split's two halves are combined with
  `feature_select_types` into one `AGGREGATE_HALF_BATCHWISE` task per (replicate, half,
  method). `PLAN_EXPERIMENTS` has already rejected an unknown or overlapping method name,
  because both lists are interpolated straight into task scripts and publish paths.
- **`BLOCKLIST_BATCHWISE` is the one gather across replicates**, and
  `COMBINE_BLOCKLISTS_BATCHWISE` the gather across methods. Both use `groupTuple` keyed on
  the experiment (and method), so a failed member task leaves its group short: that method's
  blocklist is computed from the replicates that finished.
- **Passthrough methods** (`feature_select_passthrough_types`, default `[]`) are aggregated
  on every cell, raw, and joined onto `output.parquet` by `FINALIZE_FEATURE_SELECT_BATCHWISE`
  last. With an empty list no `AGGREGATE_FEATURE_TYPE_PASSTHROUGH` task runs.

Across experiments, `fisseqborn-global` reads each experiment's per-method
`aggregates/<method>.parquet` plus its `blocklist.parquet` and votes; it does not read
`output.parquet`, whose columns are already filtered per experiment.

## CellProfiler-feature track

An optional, parallel second track processes the same experiments'
hand-engineered CellProfiler measurements. There's no separate list to
keep in sync with `experiments:` -- an entry opts itself in by setting
`cp_features: true`, which does two things: `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` (always
run, for every experiment) additionally forces that experiment's
CellProfiler CSV to exist and folds its columns into `cell_table.parquet`,
and `BUILD_CP_FEATURES` runs against that same output, selecting them back
out. No entry setting `cp_features: true` -- the default -- skips
`BUILD_CP_FEATURES` onward entirely. This track reuses that same
experiment's `QC_FILTER` output rather than running QC a second time, and
gets no bootstrap feature selection: its columns are hand-engineered and
meant to stay comparable to the published CellProfiler analysis.

```text
experiments with cp_features: true  +  BUILD_CELL_IMAGES' cell_table.parquet
    │
    ▼
BUILD_CP_FEATURES
    │
QC_FILTER ──┐  (the SAME QC_FILTER output NORMALIZE uses -- no
             │   second QC pass)
             ▼
      NORMALIZE_CP_FEATURES
             │
    ┌────────┴──────────────────────────┐

AGGREGATE_FEATURE_TYPE_CP_FEATURES   OVWT_BATCHWISE_CP_FEATURES (params.run_ovwt)
(x feature_select_types_cp_features; z-scored to the synonymous variants)
```

`BUILD_CP_FEATURES` is a flat read + column-select against
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' `cell_table.parquet` (no tile discovery, no CSV
reads of its own -- see
[Architecture](architecture.md#cell-images-build_cell_images-output-from-starcall-workflow)).
The other three processes are the same shared modules as the cellDINO track's, run with
`feature_selector=features` and publishing under `*_cp_features` directories.

### Track independence

`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` is the only stage both tracks depend on. Everything
after it is two independent chains meeting nowhere, joined only by the
`QC_FILTER` output they both consume -- and `QC_FILTER` itself depends on
neither, since `BUILD_CELL_METADATA` feeds it straight from
`cell_table.parquet`. Combined with every per-experiment process's
`errorStrategy 'ignore'`, a failure anywhere in the cellDINO track
(`EMBED_CELLS`, `NORMALIZE`, ...) leaves the CellProfiler track
running to completion, and vice versa.
`tests/integration/test_integration.py::test_cp_track_survives_embedding_failure`
pins this by failing `EMBED_CELLS` outright and asserting the
CellProfiler outputs still land.

`errorStrategy 'ignore'` also means `nextflow run` **exits 0** when a task
failed; the failure shows up as an `Error executing process` line and as
missing output files, not as an exit code.

QC sees every row of `cell_table.parquet`, so `filtered_cells.parquet`
can cover cells that never reached `embeddings.parquet` (say, a tile whose
shard job failed). Every consumer inner-joins it back on the pipeline's
`join_keys`, so the extra rows drop out where they don't apply -- and QC
thresholds don't shift depending on whether the embedding pass
succeeded.

## Profiles and containers

`nextflow.config` carries only container and profile settings -- no
executor, queue or resource settings, and no default parameter values
(those are all in `params.yaml`). Three profiles:

- **default (no `-profile`)** -- Docker, running every task in
  `params.container_image` as the invoking user
  (`docker.runOptions = '-u $(id -u):$(id -g)'`, so published outputs
  aren't root-owned).
- **`-profile apptainer`** -- the same `docker://` image through Apptainer
  (`apptainer.autoMounts = true`); the usual choice on an HPC cluster.
- **`-profile local`** -- no container at all: every task runs its `python -m`
  module against the invoking environment
  (this repo's own `uv` venv). What `tests/integration/` and CI use. There
  is no `ops` env here, so the nested starcall `snakemake` is whatever
  `snakemake` is on `PATH` -- the test suite puts a stub there.

`process.ext.snakemake_bin` (`/opt/conda/envs/ops/bin/snakemake`) and
`process.ext.conda_bin_dir` (`/opt/conda/bin`) point `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` at
the image's `ops` env by absolute path, and `process.ext.fisseq_snakefile`
(`/opt/fisseq-embeddings-pipeline/snakemake/Snakefile`) at the Snakefile it
runs -- starcall's own, cloned into the image at a pinned commit,
plus `make_cell_shard`. That env is deliberately kept off
`PATH` so bare `python` always resolves to this repo's own Python 3.13
venv; `conda_bin_dir` is prepended onto `PATH` for the one nested
invocation only, because `--use-conda` shells out to a bare `conda`.
`-profile local` resets the first two, and points `fisseq_snakefile` at
`${projectDir}/snakemake/Snakefile`.

### Bind mounts

Nextflow mounts each task's own work directory into its container; any
other host path a task reaches has to be bound explicitly. Two processes
need that, via `containerOptions` closures in `nextflow.config` (`-v` under
Docker, `-B` under Apptainer):

- **`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`** -- the plan's `bind_paths` (the experiment's
  `starcall_workflow_dir` plus any data dir set explicitly in its entry),
  the snakemake cache dir, and `starcall_profile` if set. Plus `--nv` /
  `--gpus all` when `starcall_gpu` is true.
- **`EMBED_CELLS`** -- `cell_dino_checkpoint`, and the experiment's
  resolved `phenotyping_dir` (emitted by `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` as an
  `env("phenotyping_dir")` output): `tiles.parquet` names each tile's shard
  by its real path there, and the shards are read in place. Plus `--nv` /
  `--gpus all` unless `cell_dino_device` is `cpu`.

Every path is bound at its own unchanged absolute location (`src:src`).
That is mandatory, not tidiness: starcall-workflow's rules build every
output path by literal string concatenation onto
`phenotyping_dir`/`segmentation_dir`/`sequencing_dir`.

A data dir resolved from the starcall project's own `config.yaml` to
somewhere *outside* `starcall_workflow_dir` isn't known before the run, so
isn't in `bind_paths`: either set it explicitly on the experiment entry, or
bind its storage root in your site config (`apptainer.runOptions = '-B
/shared/storage'`, or `docker.runOptions`).

!!! warning "Docker's `--gpus` fails on a GPU-less host"

    `apptainer exec --nv` on a GPU-less host warns and proceeds;
    `docker run --gpus all` fails outright before the container starts.
    `starcall_gpu` defaults to `true`, so set it to `false` (and
    `cell_dino_device` to `cpu`) when running under Docker without a GPU.

## Running on a cluster: bring your own profiles

Nothing scheduler-specific lives in this repo. A cluster run takes two
pieces of site configuration, both yours:

1. a **Nextflow config** for the outer pipeline, passed with `-c`, and
2. optionally, a **snakemake 7 profile** for the nested starcall run,
   passed as `--starcall_profile`, so starcall's own rules fan out across
   the cluster too.

### The outer pipeline: `-c site.config`

Executor, queue, per-label resources, the Apptainer cache and any extra
bind paths. Every module carries one of `process_single`/`process_low`/
`process_medium`/`process_high` (plus `process_gpu` on `EMBED_CELLS`) for
this purpose. A generic example:

```groovy
// site.config -- pass with: nextflow run . -profile apptainer -c site.config ...
process {
    executor = 'slurm'          // or 'sge', 'pbspro', 'lsf', ...
    queue    = 'general'
    withLabel: 'process_low'    { cpus = 2; memory = 8.GB }
    withLabel: 'process_medium' { cpus = 4; memory = 32.GB }
    withLabel: 'process_high'   { cpus = 8; memory = 64.GB }
    withName:  'EMBED_CELLS'    { clusterOptions = '--gres=gpu:1' }
    // BUILD_CELL_IMAGES is a babysitter for the nested snakemake in
    // cluster mode, but runs every starcall rule itself in local mode.
    withName:  'BUILD_CELL_IMAGES' { cpus = 4; memory = 32.GB; time = '72h' }
}
apptainer {
    cacheDir   = '/shared/apptainer-cache'
    runOptions = '-B /shared/storage'
}
```

Each task exports `POLARS_MAX_THREADS`/`OMP_NUM_THREADS`/... from its own
`task.cpus` (see [Modules](#modules)), so setting `cpus` per label is also
what keeps several tasks on one node from oversubscribing it.

### The nested starcall run: `starcall_profile`

By default `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' nested snakemake runs in **local mode**:
`--cores {snakemake_cores}`, every starcall rule a subprocess of the one
task. There is parallelism *across* experiments and none *within* one.

Set three params to fan starcall's rules out instead:

| Param | What it is |
|---|---|
| `starcall_profile` | A snakemake **7** profile directory (a `config.yaml` inside it) saying how to submit jobs: `cluster:`, `cluster-cancel:`, `jobs:`, and optionally `default-resources`/`set-resources`, `latency-wait`, `retries`. Bound into the task's container automatically. |
| `starcall_job_image` | A `.sif` of `container_image` on storage every compute node can read. Required with `starcall_profile` (`PLAN_EXPERIMENTS` fails fast without it). |
| `starcall_container_bin` | What a child job re-enters the image with. Default `apptainer`; some nodes only ship `singularity`. |

A minimal profile looks like:

```yaml
# my-starcall-profile/config.yaml -- snakemake 7 syntax
cluster: "submit-job --cpus {threads} --mem {resources.mem_mb}M"   # your scheduler's submit command; must print the job id first
cluster-cancel: "cancel-job"
jobs: 64
latency-wait: 120
default-resources: [cuda=0]
# starcall-workflow's devel branch has `cuda = 1` commented out on its
# segmentation rules, so request the GPU explicitly if your submit
# command keys off resources.cuda:
set-resources: [segment_nuclei:cuda=1, segment_cells:cuda=1]
```

With `starcall_profile` set, the nested invocation becomes

```text
snakemake --snakefile /opt/fisseq-embeddings-pipeline/snakemake/Snakefile --directory <starcall_workflow_dir> \
    --profile <starcall_profile> --jobscript $PWD/starcall_jobscript.sh \
    --use-conda --conda-frontend conda --rerun-triggers mtime --rerun-incomplete \
    --config phenotyping_dir=... segmentation_dir=... sequencing_dir=... fisseq_python=... -- <targets>
```

with no `--cores`: in cluster mode that's the budget across all submitted
jobs and silently caps every rule's own `threads:`, so it belongs in the
profile (or leave it to `jobs:`).

How the pieces fit:

- **The submitter runs inside `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' container.** snakemake
  bakes its own `sys.executable` -- the image's
  `/opt/conda/envs/ops/bin/python3.10` -- into every jobscript, so the
  submitter has to be the in-image snakemake. That means your profile's
  `cluster:` command runs **inside the container** too: the scheduler
  client (`qsub`, `sbatch`, ...) and whatever environment it needs must be
  reachable there. Bind its install and config in via your site config
  (`apptainer.runOptions`), and set any environment it reads
  (`apptainer.envWhitelist`, or `env` in the site config).
- **Every child job re-enters the image.** A child job lands on a bare
  node, but starcall's rules are overwhelmingly `run:` blocks, which
  execute inside the child snakemake's own interpreter and import
  numpy/tifffile/starcall/tensorflow -- snakemake never containerizes a
  `run:` body. So `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`' enumerate phase writes
  `starcall_jobscript.sh` (`render_starcall_jobscript` in
  `build_cell_images_enumerate.py`) and passes it as `--jobscript`. It
  re-executes itself once inside `starcall_job_image` (`<starcall_container_bin>
  exec [--nv] --bind ... <image> /bin/sh -c "$(cat "$0")" "$0"`, guarded by an environment
  variable Apptainer passes through), then runs the job as usual.
- **Binds are baked in.** The jobscript binds, at unchanged paths, the
  resolved `phenotyping_dir`/`segmentation_dir`/`sequencing_dir`,
  `starcall_workflow_dir`, the snakemake cache dir, and the task's own work
  directory -- snakemake prefixes every cluster job with `cd <the directory
  the submitter was launched from>`, which is that work directory. So the
  Nextflow work directory has to be on shared storage, as it already must
  be for any cluster executor.
- **GPU.** `starcall_gpu: true` adds `--nv` to every child job's re-entry;
  Apptainer only warns on a GPU-less node. Which jobs get a GPU *node* is
  your profile's business (`set-resources` above).
- **Stale locks.** A killed run leaves a lock in
  `<starcall_workflow_dir>/.snakemake/locks/`; every run clears it first
  with a `snakemake --unlock`. That is safe only because each experiment
  has its own `starcall_workflow_dir` and concurrent runs against one tree
  are forbidden.
- **Orphans.** snakemake runs your profile's `cluster-cancel` on a
  graceful shutdown; a SIGKILLed submitter can leave child jobs queued, to
  sweep by hand with your scheduler's tools.

The nested snakemake is pinned to **7.32.4** in the `Dockerfile`,
deliberately: the `ops` env is Python 3.10 and every snakemake >=8
requires >=3.11. `--cluster`/`--cluster-cancel`/`--jobscript` are 7.x
features; snakemake 8 replaced them with the executor-plugin interface,
which is out of reach until `ops` moves to Python >=3.11. The integration
suite's `test_real_starcall_profile_mode` exercises this path with real
snakemake 7 and a fake "cluster" -- everything except a real `apptainer`
re-entering the `.sif` on a node, which only a real cluster can check.

## Shared modules

The processes both pipelines run have one copy, in fisseq-common:
`packages/fisseq-common/nextflow/modules/local/<stage>/main.nf` (QC_FILTER, FILTER,
OVWT_BATCHWISE, AGGREGATE, GENERATE_SPLIT, CORRELATE_FEATURES, BLOCKLIST, COMBINE_BLOCKLISTS,
FINALIZE_FEATURE_SELECT), plus `functions.nf` (`threadEnv`, `hydraList`). Each hardcodes its
entry point, `python -m fisseq_common.stages.<stage>`, and passes what both pipelines pass
alike. The workflow includes them under the data pipeline's process names
(`include { FILTER as NORMALIZE } from '../../fisseq-common/nextflow/modules/local/filter/main.nf'`),
and this pipeline's `conf/modules.config` sets, per process name, only:

- `ext.args`: `join_keys` (`[meta_batch,meta_well,meta_tile,meta_cell_index]`),
  `feature_selector` (`embeddings`; `features` on the CP track), QC_FILTER's
  `sort_output_by`, the aggregate processes' `downsample_wt` and `normalize_to_synonymous`, and
  BLOCKLIST's `minimum_correlation`;
- `ext.seed`: `AGGREGATE_HALF_BATCHWISE`'s per-half seed, `random_seed + rep * 2 + half`;
- `publishDir`: where its outputs go under `pipeline_dir`, matching
  `fisseq_common.layout.EmbeddingsPipelineLayout` (`tests/unit/test_publish_layout.py` checks).

See [Shared Nextflow modules](../common/nextflow.md).

## Modules

This pipeline's own modules (`PLAN_EXPERIMENTS`, `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES`, `BUILD_CELL_METADATA`,
`EMBED_CELLS`, `BUILD_CP_FEATURES`) follow the same shape as the shared ones:

```groovy
include { threadEnv } from '../../../../fisseq-common/nextflow/modules/local/functions'

process EMBED_CELLS {
    errorStrategy 'ignore'
    label 'process_gpu'
    container "${params.container_image}"
    publishDir { "${params.pipeline_dir}/embeddings/${batch_stem}" }, mode: 'copy'
    ...
    script:
    """
    ${threadEnv(task.cpus)}
    python -m fisseq_embeddings_pipeline.embed \\
        output_dir=. \\
        ... \\
        random_seed=${params.random_seed}
    """
}
```

- **`errorStrategy 'ignore'`** on every per-experiment process, so
  independent branches keep running when one fails (`PLAN_EXPERIMENTS` is
  the exception).
- **`publishDir ..., mode: 'copy'`** into `pipeline_dir`: real copies, so
  results don't depend on `work/` surviving. `BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` publishes
  only `cell_table.parquet`/`tiles.parquet`; its scratch files
  (`targets.txt`, `tiles_manifest.csv`, `resolved_dirs.env`, the
  jobscript) stay in its work directory.
- **`threadEnv(task.cpus)`** (fisseq-common's `functions.nf`) exports
  `POLARS_MAX_THREADS`/`OMP_NUM_THREADS`/`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS`/... inside
  the script itself -- not as a `beforeScript`, which runs on the host,
  outside the container. `hydraList(key, values)` renders a list as one
  shell-safe `'key=[a,b]'` override.
- **`output_dir=.`** and a trailing **`random_seed=...`** on every stage invocation.

`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` is the one exception to "one `python -m` call": three
phases, the middle one a nested `snakemake` (which itself runs `python -m
fisseq_embeddings_pipeline.tile_shard` once per tile, as
`make_cell_shard`). See
[`build_cell_images_enumerate`](cli/build_cell_images_enumerate.md) and
[Cell Shards](cli/tile_shard.md).

### `-resume`

`-resume` reuses a task whenever its inputs hash the same. For
`BUILD_CELL_IMAGES` the inputs are the experiment's plan -- values, not
files -- so `-resume` won't notice new or changed data under
`starcall_workflow_dir`. Rerun without `-resume` (or with
`-resume` after deleting that task's work directory) to pick those up; the
nested snakemake's own mtime-based rerun then recomputes only what
changed.

## Output directory layout

The paths are `fisseq_common.layout.EmbeddingsPipelineLayout`'s. Everything from
`qc_filter/` down is laid out exactly as in fisseq-data-pipeline.

Each stage's own `<stage>.log` (written by `fisseq_common.utils.log` into
`output_dir`) stays in that task's hashed `work/` directory alongside
Nextflow's `.command.log`/`.command.err`; it isn't published.

The `cp_features/`, `normalization_cp_features/`, `ovwt_batchwise_cp_features/` and
`feature_select_batchwise_cp_features/` directories only
appear when at least one `params.experiments` entry sets `cp_features:
true` (see [CellProfiler-feature track](#cellprofiler-feature-track)
above).

The WebDataset shards -- one per tile,
`<segmentation_type>_{raw|corrected}_shard_<window>.tar`, all cells,
unfiltered -- stay under starcall's `phenotyping_dir`, next to that tile's
other outputs, not here: `EMBED_CELLS` reads them in place via
`tiles.parquet`, and snakemake's own mtime check reuses them on a rerun.
The whole-tile `raw_pt.tif`/`corrected_pt.tif` they're cut from is a
`temp()` output upstream and no longer a target, so snakemake deletes it
once the shard is cut -- see [Architecture](architecture.md) decision 17.

See the [Stage Reference](cli/tile_shard.md) pages and
[Shared stages](../common/stages.md) for each file's exact column set.
